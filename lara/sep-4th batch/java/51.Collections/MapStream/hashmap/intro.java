//map is key value pair
//while storing any value in the map, that element should be assigned with a key
//every element should have key
//key should be unique.all keys are unique
//for one(same) key multiple values can't be assigned.so all the keys should be unique

//to identify duplicates keys , it is using hash code() and equals() methods

//value need not to be unique
/*under map, the important classes are : hashmap,
										 hashtable, 
										 linked hashmap, 
										 treemap
*/

//hashmap allows null as a key and as a value
//hashtable won't allow null as a key or value
//hashtable is a syncshronized
//linked hashmap maintains the order
//treemap is used for sorting purpose.sorting is based on the keys , but not based on values(elements)
