}
//integer reprsentation of memory address
//we get hexadecimal representaiton of memory address
//inside class A ,toString method is available
// all the methods of Object class are inheriting to sub class(means every class as object class is super most class)

//inside class every Object class member is available
//whenever we are trying to print raference, internally it calls OtoString() method of object class which returns memory address of the object
//toString method returns class name@ memory address of the Object in hexadecimal form
