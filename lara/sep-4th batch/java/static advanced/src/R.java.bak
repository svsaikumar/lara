//we can use static members of one class in another class
//while one method in another class then we have to use it along with the class name
//here we are running R, so R is loaded.while executing R it requires Q.then it loads Q
//here we are running R but not Q.we are using Q.so there is no need to present main method in Q
//while using Q first time it loads into the memory,after that we can use it anu numbr of ti mes
