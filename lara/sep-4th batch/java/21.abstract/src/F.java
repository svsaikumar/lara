//eventhough class is abstract, it is not mandatory that it should contain abstract methods.so we didn't get any CTE here
//any class can be declared as abstract eventhough there are no abstract methods inside that class
//empty class can also be declared as abstract
//an abstract class can have any number of abstract methods
