//upto now we made sql as client to data base
/* inside sql developer is not a database
it is client to develop our stored data in the database
similar to sql developer let us develop a java program which has to interracting with the data base
in place of sql we are using java program which has to interacting with the database
in jdbc thera are 2 packages
			-java.sql
			-javax.sql
	driver registration: first driver has to register.once driver is registered then we can establish a connection form fa java program to database
	then we can send any number of sql commands to database

//NOW making java program itself as a client to  data base(in JDBC)
