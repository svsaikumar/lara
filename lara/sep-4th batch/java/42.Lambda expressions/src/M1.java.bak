//lamda expressions are introdeced in JDK 1.8 in order to single method interfaces
//any interface without memberes is known as marker interface
//any interface with only one method is known as fuctional interface
//main marker interfare are clonable and serializable
//functional interface
	//runnable only one method
	//comparible that containlng only method
	//comparator functional interface
//lamda expressions are  only for functional interfaces
