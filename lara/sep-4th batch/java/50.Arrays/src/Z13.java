//here we are not changing the size of the aray, we are developing the new array
//in one array only one tpe of elements can be stored.we can't store multiple type of elements
//but we can store sub class data type elements(in int we can store byte and short elements)
//array are only one type of elements
//inside array except sort built in method, there is no another method for modifying the array


//limitations of array
//size of array is not changable once array defined
//arrys are for only one type of elements.we can't store multiple types of arrays
//manipulating or managing of elemements in array is difficult
